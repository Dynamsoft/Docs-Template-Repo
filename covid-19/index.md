# How Dynamsoft Barcode Reader helps fight against COVID-19 in healthcare, retail and other industries

## Healthcare - Track COVID-19 Diagnostic Samples

![Vault Health User Story][1]

Vault Health, Inc. is a New York-based company that provides services related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing and other healthcare needs. Its customers come from across many industries, including consumer, business, and government. Vault Health has done millions of COVID-19 tests, using barcoding technology to track the samples. Accurate recording of COVID-19 diagnostic samples is paramount.

Here is how it works. On Vault Health’s website, a customer orders the test. A box containing their saliva sample collection kit is sent to the customer’s home, where the user follows instructions to open the box. The user uses the Dynamsoft barcode web SDK scanner to accurately and easily scan the barcode of their sample collection kit and register it with Vault Health’s software. Then the saliva sample collection is supervised by a Vault Health test supervisor remotely (via a  Zoom video call), and the sample is sent back to a laboratory for testing.  

The key feature that Vault Health requires in their application is 100% accuracy in a web-based barcode scanner. Also, the barcode scanner needs to work on mobile and desktop browsers. Vault Health validated Dynamsoft Barcode Reader against other offerings and found it was the best option. The company chose Dynamsoft because of the quality of its barcode scanner. Dynamsoft’s javascript barcode SDK offers the benefits of ease of implementation, flexible licensing, and ease of use.

Vault Health designed their application quickly in two weeks from the point of planning to actually making it available for use.

## Retail - Contactless Shopping

Lee Valley Tools is taking its in-store COVID-19 precautions a step further with the launch of a new mobile shopping tool, which incorporates the JavaScript edition of the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader. Integrated with Lee Valley's website, LeeValley.com, the new tool allows for mobile contactless shopping in each of its 20 locations across the country.

Over the last six months, Lee Valley Tools has enacted a variety of in-store safety measures. The launch of the new mobile feature brings an added level of safety to the in-store shopping experience.

The mobile feature is easy to use as customers don't need to download anything on their mobile device, instead they simply visit LeeValley.com when they enter the physical store, click on the barcode icon, select their store location, and start shopping. The online feature also allows customers to scan an item's bar code and see a full description of every product offered by Lee Valley Tools before deciding to purchase – from drills to dovetail saws.

"The health and safety of our customers and staff is our number one priority and our new easy-to-use mobile feature provides another layer of protection while shopping in-store during these unprecedented times," said Jason Tassé, Chief Operating Officer, Lee Valley Tools. "We're thrilled to launch this mobile tool in all our stores across Canada to give our customers a user-friendly way of making the browsing and purchase process contactless."
